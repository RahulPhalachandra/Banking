# Banking

Types of Banking
Banks are further segregated into four types.

Commercial banks: These banks are regulated by Banking Regulation Act, 1949. They accept the public deposit from the public for lending or investment.

Cooperative banks: Cooperative banks are undertaken by the State Cooperative Societies Act and give cheap credit to their members. The rural population is dependent on the cooperative banks for its financial backup.

Specialised banks: These banks provide financial help to special industries, foreign trade, etc. Few examples of specialised banks are foreign exchange banks, export and import banks, development banks, etc.

Central banks: These banks manage, check, and monitor all the activities of the commercial banks of a country.
